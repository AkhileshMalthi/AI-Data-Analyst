# AI-Data-Analyst

This project builds a user-friendly system that understands user queries and performs data analysis based on them.

### Project Overview

The system consists of three main modules:

1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**
    * Identifies the intent behind user queries (e.g., trend analysis for sales data).
    * Extracts relevant entities from queries (e.g., dates, metrics, data types).
    * Utilizes NLP libraries like spaCy or NLTK for processing.
    * Might leverage pre-trained models like BERT or GPT for advanced context understanding.

2. **Data Handling and Preparation:**
    * Allows users to upload data in various formats (CSV, Excel) using libraries like Pandas.
    * Implements data validation checks for data suitability.

3. **Execution Engine:**
    * Generates Python code snippets based on interpreted queries to perform the required analysis.
    * Employs a secure environment (like Docker) to run the generated code for user data and system safety.

### User Interface

* A web interface allows users to type queries intuitively.
* The interface might guide users on formulating effective questions.
* A feedback mechanism allows users to improve the NLP model over time.

###  Additional Considerations

* **Error Handling:** Implement mechanisms to handle errors in queries, data uploads, and code execution.
* **Data Security:** Prioritize data security measures throughout the process.
* **Visualization Integration:** Consider integrating data visualization tools to present analysis results effectively.
* **Scalability:** Plan for future growth by incorporating a scalable architecture.

### Getting Started

This is a work-in-progress project. The specific setup instructions will be added as development progresses.
