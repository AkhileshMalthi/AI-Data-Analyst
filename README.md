# AI Data Analyst Project ( In Progress )

## Overview

This project aims to develop an AI Data Analyst similar to Julius.ai using pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs). The AI will perform tasks such as data cleaning, data analysis, generating insights, and creating visualizations.

## Objectives and Requirements

### Objectives
- Perform data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- Generate insights from various types of data (e.g., financial data, sales data, customer data).

### Requirements
- User Interface: Web-based, mobile app, or desktop application.
- Pre-trained LLMs: GPT-3, GPT-4, etc.
- Computational Resources: Cloud services like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

## Steps to Develop the AI Data Analyst

### Step 1: Define Your Objectives and Requirements
- Determine specific tasks for the AI.
- Identify the types of data the AI will work with.

### Step 2: Data Preparation
- **Collect Data**: Gather datasets for training and testing.
- **Clean and Preprocess Data**: Handle missing values, outliers, and irrelevant features. Normalize or standardize data if required.

### Step 3: Model Selection and Fine-Tuning
- **Choose a Pre-Trained LLM**: Select a suitable model (e.g., GPT-4).
- **Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tune the LLM on domain-specific data using techniques like transfer learning.

### Step 4: Develop the Backend
- **Model Deployment**: Use frameworks like TensorFlow Serving, FastAPI, or Flask to deploy the model.
- **Data Analysis and Processing Pipeline**: Create a pipeline for data ingestion and processing. Implement necessary data analysis functions.

### Step 5: Develop the Frontend
- **User Interface**: Design a user-friendly interface using frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js.
- **Integrate with Backend**: Connect the frontend with backend services for data input, analysis, and visualization.

### Step 6: Testing and Evaluation
- **Test Your System**: Conduct extensive testing on various datasets and use cases.
- **Evaluate Performance**: Measure performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Continuously monitor and improve based on feedback.

### Step 7: Deployment and Maintenance
- **Deployment**: Deploy the application to a production environment with monitoring and logging.
- **Maintenance**: Regularly update models and codebase. Monitor user feedback and continuously improve the system.
